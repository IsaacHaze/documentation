title: Vespa application system tests
---

<p>
  System tests are an invaluable tool both when developing and maintaing a complex Vespa application.
  These are functional tests which are run against a deployment of the application package to verify,
  and use its HTTP APIs to execute feed and query operations which are compared to expected outcomes. 
  Vespa provides two formalizations of this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="reference/testing.html">Basic HTTP tests</a>, expressing requests and expected responses as JSON,
    and run with the <a href="vespa-cli.html">Vespa CLI</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p><a href="reference/testing-java.html">Java JUnit tests</a>, for more advanced tests,
    run as regular Java tests, with some extra configuration.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
  These two frameworks also includes an upgrade—or staging—test construct for scenarios where the application
  is upgraded, and state in the backend depends on the old application configuration;
  as well as a production verification test—basically a health check for production deployments.
  For system and staging tests, the frameworks provide an easy way to perform HTTP request against a
  designated test deployment, separating the tests from the deployment and configuration of the test clusters.
</p>
<p>
  The rest of this document describes how each of these test categories can be run as part of an imagined
  CI/CD system for safely deploying changes to a Vespa application in a continuous manner. 
</p>



<h2 id="system-tests">System tests</h2>
<p>
  System tests are just functional tests that verify a deployed Vespa application behaves as expected
  when fed and queried. Running a system test is as simple as making a separate deployment with the
  application package to test, and then running the system test suite, or one or a few or those tests.
</p>
<p>
  Each system test should be self-contained, i.e., it should be able to run each test in isolation;
  or all tests, in any order. To achieve this, <strong>system tests should generally start by clearing all
  documents from the cluster to test.</strong> This is the case with our sample system tests, so take
  care to not run them against a production cluster.
</p>
<p>
  For the most part, system tests must be updated due to changes in the application package.
  Rarely, an upgrade of the Vespa version may also lead to changed functionality, but within
  major versions, this should only be new features and bug fixes. In any case, it is a good idea
  to always run system tests against a dedicated test deployment—both before upgrading the Vespa
  platform, and the application package—before deploying the change to production.
</p>



<h2 id="staging-tests">Staging tests</h2>
<p>
  The goal of staging (upgrade) tests is <em>not</em> to ensure the new deployment
  satisfies its functional specifications, as that should be covered by
  system tests; rather, it is to ensure the upgrade of the application
  package and/or Vespa platform does not break the application, and is
  compatible with the behavior expected by existing clients.
</p>
<p>
  Running a staging test therefore requires more steps than a system test:
</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>First, a dedicated deployment is made with the <em>current</em> setup (package and Vespa version).</p></li>
    <li><p>Next, <em>staging setup</em> code is run to put the test cluster in a particular state—typically
      one that mimics the state in production clusters.</p></li>
    <li><p>When this is done, the deployment is upgraded to the <em>new</em> setup (package and/or Vespa version).</p></li>
    <li><p>Finally, <em>staging test</em> code is run to verify the cluster behaves as expected post-upgrade.</p></li>
  </ol>
<p>
  As an example, consider a change in how documents are indexed, e.g., a adding new document processor.
  A system test would test verify this new behavior by feeding a document, and then verifying the
  document processor modified the document, or perhaps did something else.
  A staging test, on the other hand, would feed the document <em>before</em> the document processor was added,
  and querying for the document after the upgrade could give different results
  from what the system test would expect.
</p>
<p>Many such changes, which require additional action post-deployment, are also guarded by 
  <a href="reference/validation-overrides.html">validation overrides</a>,
  but the staging test is then a great way of figuring out what the exact consequences of the change are,
  and how to deal with it. 
</p>
<p>
  As opposed to system tests, staging tests are not self-contained, as the state change during upgrade is
  precisely what is tested. Instead, execution order of any staging tests that modify state, particularly
  after upgrade, must be controlled. Indeed, some changes will require refeeding data, and this should then be
  part of the <em>staging test</em> code. Finally, it is also good to verify the expected state prior to upgrade.
</p>
<p>
  The clients of a Vespa application should be compatible with both the system and staging test expectations,
  and this dictates the workflow when deploying a breaking change:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>First, the application code and system and and staging tests are updated, so tests pass; 
    and clients are updated to reflect the updated test code.<p></li>
  <li><p>Next, the application is upgraded.</p></li>
  <li><p>Finally, the <em>staging setup</em> code is updated to match the new application code.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
  Again, it is a good idea to always run staging tests before deployment of every change—be it a
  change in the application package, or an upgrade of the Vespa platform.
</p>



<h2 id="production-tests">Production tests</h2>
<p>
  Some changes cannot be properly tested outside of a production setting; examples include user engagement,
  and other high level metrics. Upgrading a subset of production clusters first, allows detecting a regression
  here, and stopping the change from deploying to the rest of the production clusters.
</p>
<p>
  These tests will be completely domain-dependent, and typically not run against the Vespa application
  itself. The test framework therefore has less tooling here, and really only specifies this is a separate category.
